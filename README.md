## Why?

Vue appears to be a widely used framework - I wanted to see how it compares to React.

## What problem does it solve?

Like React, it allows you to easily build applications from many small components. You can focus on individual features and avoid falling down a rabbit hole.

## Opinion

After learning React, Vue concepts are easy to understand. The syntax is a little hard to get used to though. There is a little more boilerplate that goes along with Vue.
